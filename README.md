# ahmeds-game

This my repo for a browser based game that I designed and coded using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript; as part of the Nology Course.

The Design:
The game was designed with a CSS Flexbox layout using SCSS.

The Logic:

The logic of the game consists of JavaScript functions using simple if/else statements. I created DOM elements and corresponding event listeners for the objects in the game (boat, goat, wolf, pumpkin).
